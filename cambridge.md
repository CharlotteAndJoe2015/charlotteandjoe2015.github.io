##Things To Do

For those arriving on Saturday, or attending the evening reception, we reccomend spending some time in Cambridge city itself. There's plenty to see and do, these are our personal sugggestions.

###Walk Around the City Centre

As featured in many films and television series such as 'The Theory of Everything' and 'Grantchester', Cambridge is a really pretty place just to take a stroll around. Here is a nice little walk that we usually take friends and family on, and typically takes about 25 minutes. It features the beautiful King's College, with its iconic gothic chapel; 'The Backs', with all the pretty bridges over the river Cam; and a few tiny alleys running through Trinity College.

###Punting

<img src="/Punting.png" align="right">
Of course no trip to Cambridge would be complete without a punt! You can either hire your own punt, or take a guided punt tour. Having tried and tested both, we would definitely reccommend the tour option - it's much less effort, you can relax with a glass of Pimm's or Champagne, and learn interesting (often questionable) facts about the city and university. 

[Scudamore's](http://www.scudamores.com/) is the largest company, running punting trips from [Granta Place](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Scudamore's+Boatyard/@52.201057,0.116182,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d870a34a1b9acd:0xf4ca551a0da78cb7) and [Magdalene Street](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Scudamore's+Punting+Company/@52.209809,0.116729,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d870a34a1b9acd:0xf9c5d731f202f46a). You also won't be able to escape the student 'touts' offering guided tours and punts near the Market Square and King's. Personally we'd avoid them.

###Picnic

If the weather is nice, a picnic by the river is lovely. Our favourite spots are on [Jesus Green](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Jesus+Green/@52.211508,0.122904,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d870952ddb593f:0x6c0a770654764ce1) and [Coe Fen](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Coe+Fen/@52.1991153,0.1182741,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x90c3ffe5c4ef640e)

###Shopping
Cambridge is a great place for shopping, with most high street chains and a John Lewis. There are also some lovely little shops in the back streets - we (Charlotte!) particularly like:

* [Ness](http://www.ness.co.uk/ness-stores) for Scottish-inspired fashion
* [Nord](http://www.nordesign.co.uk/) for Scandi design
* [Chocolat Chocolat](http://www.chocolatchocolat.co.uk) for, er.... chocolate!
* And [Cambridge Market](http://www.visitcambridge.org/shopping/cambridge-market-p528371) for a bit of everything (including a hair cut!)

###Colleges and Museums

You should definitely go check out [King's](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/King's+College/@52.204278,0.116594,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d870bb7b0a70af:0x9011546d14b61613), [John's](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/St+John's+College/@52.207738,0.117867,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d870bdc55d733f:0x9e62883a7cfce8f) and [Trinity](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/King's+College/@52.204278,0.116594,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d870bb7b0a70af:0x9011546d14b61613) colleges, as well as [Trinity Hall](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Trinity+Hall+Cambridge/@52.205739,0.115133,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d870be90940b35:0xffdd76b080e062f9) - if only to poke your head through the sally port.

The [Fitzwilliam Museum](http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/) is free to enter and houses a 'world-class collection of art and antiques spanning centuries'.

[Kettle's Yard](http://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/) is a free admission art gallary with 20th century, contemporary and modern art exhibitions (we're not sure if those are three different genres!) 

###Cycling

<img src="/Cycling.png" align="left">
Cambridge is *very* flat, so easy going on a bike. It's also very safe and great fun to pootle around the city and explore. If you fancy more of a challenge, there's a guided bus way and cycle path that runs all the way to St Ives. You could also ride to the [Science Park](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Cambridge+Science+Park/@52.2321914,0.1468919,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0xf354e69dd347f41a) and check out all the companies based in 'Silicon Fen'.

You can hire bikes from [City Cycle Hire](http://www.citycyclehire.com/), [Station Cycles](http://stationcycles.co.uk/) and [Cambridge Bike Tours](http://www.cambridgebiketours.co.uk/). Sorry no 'Boris (Ken!) bikes'. I suggest you bring your own bike, and bring a lock!

###Botanic Gardens
Apparently these are very nice. Click [here](http://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/Botanic/Home.aspx) to find out more.

###American Cemetery and Memorial

If you fancy a trip out of Cambridge, the [Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_American_Cemetery_and_Memorial) is very moving and worth a [visit](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Cambridge+American+Cemetery+and+Memorial/@52.216113,0.053794,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xba32f7383418c747).

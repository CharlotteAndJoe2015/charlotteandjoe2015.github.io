title: Gift List
---

Apparently it is customary to suggest gifts that you can give us to 'set us up for the future'. Having left home long ago, and lived together for over six years, we feel that we have most things we need in life, except a home to put them in! So if you would like to contribute to our house deposit fund then please bring a cheque along to the reception and post it in our gift box. Alternatively if you would prefer to transfer money directly please let us know and we will send bank details.

We do, however, have a selected few items available on our list at John Lewis (Charlotte still has a few kitchen cupboards to fill) if you would prefer to give us something physical. The gift list number is 631565, and it will open on the 22nd March.

Of course not all gifts need to cost money. We will have a scrap book at the reception venue into which you can paste your best tips, tricks and guidance. It really can be anything, from your favourite home cooking recipe, to instructions on how to detail your car. Just make it look pretty and stick it in when you arrive. We will think of you whenever we look up your contribution!

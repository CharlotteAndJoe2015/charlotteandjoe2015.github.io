There is a vast array of accommodation available in and around Cambridge, from hotels, to B&Bs and, if you’re feeling brave, campsites!

If you’re planning on coming for the whole weekend, we’d recommend stopping in Cambridge itself to be able to explore the many sights of the city - all of which are within easy walking distance. Having said that, the mode de rigueur of transport around the city is the bicycle! So when in Rome... 

There are many Fawlty Towers hotels in Cambridge. If you fancy risking meeting Basil and Sybil the [Visit Cambridge](http://www.visitcambridge.org/accommodation) website (www.visitcambridge.org) has a list of hotels, B&Bs and guest houses. We would also reccomend one of the multiple [Premier Inns](http://www.premierinn.com/en/search!execute.action) and [Travelodges](http://www.travelodge.co.uk/search_and_book/) around Cambridge. The Newmarket Road Premier Inn and Travelodges, as well as the Orchard Park Trevelodge, are all newly built, so should be clean and fresh.

If you are only staying for the one night, or fancy stopping closer to the reception venue, South Farm have prepared a list of [hotels](http://www.south-farm.co.uk/suppliers/detail.asp?Cat=Accommodation+-+Hotels) and [B&Bs](http://www.south-farm.co.uk/suppliers/detail.asp?Cat=Accommodation+-+B%26Bs) offering special rates for wedding guests.

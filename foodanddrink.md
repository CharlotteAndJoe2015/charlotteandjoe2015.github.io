title: Eating and Drinking
---

We will of course feed and water you during the reception, however, as the breakfast is quite late in the day (see the [timetable](\weekend.html)) we suggest you have a late brunch.

For our evening guests and those staying for the whole weekend, here are our recommendations on where to eat and drink. There are lots of great places, and we still have a lot of places to try ourselves. However, these are the places that we *have* visited so far and like best.


##Eating

* [The Cambridge Brew House](http://www.thecambridgebrewhouse.com/) - Our favourite. Really yummy sharing platters, and amazing beer selection. We'll be here on Saturday night. Come along!
* [The Pint Shop](http://pintshop.co.uk/) - 'Meat.Bread.Beer.' Rather hipster, but the selection of craft beers, wine and meat dishes is excellent.
* [Aromi Caffe](http://www.aromi.co.uk/) - An amazing Italian cafe selling fresh pizza, panini and pastries.
* [D'Arry's](http://www.darrys.co.uk/) - Nice restaurant serving modern British food (yes Zoe, you've been here)
* [Nanna Mexico](http://www.nannamexico.com/) - Very yummy mexican food
* [The Anchor](http://www.metropolitanpubcompany.com/our-pubs/the-anchor/) - A great gastro pub. It's on the walk we suggest in the [Cambridge](\cambridge.html) page.
* [Alimentum](http://www.restaurantalimentum.co.uk/) - a Michelin Star restaurant near the train station. Are you feeling afluent?
* [The Wrestlers](http://www.thewrestlerscambridge.co.uk/) - Real ales, wines and an amazing Thai kitchen.
* [Five Guys Burgers and Fries](https://www.fiveguys.co.uk/) - The best burgers and fries in the whole UK and USA. [Have yourself a double cheesburger. Dayum, dayum, dayuum!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcJFdCmN98s).

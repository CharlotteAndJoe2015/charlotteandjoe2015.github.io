##Saturday

We'll also be holding a get together in central Cambridge on the Saturday night before the wedding (2nd May). Anyone who is up for the weekend is welcome to join! We've booked the upstairs function room in the [Cambridge Brew House](http://www.thecambridgebrewhouse.com/). They serve great food and drink and it's looking likely that we'll hold a pub quiz.

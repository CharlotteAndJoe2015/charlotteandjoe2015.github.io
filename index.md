Hello viewers!
<img src="/CanyonCoffee.png" align="left">

Welcome to our pretentious wedding website.

Here you can find information about Joe's latest innovations and publications...oh wait sorry I'm not allowed to write about those here apparently. Don't worry, I'll give you a short lecture during the reception.

OK, this website is really intended to provide you with more information about what will be happening over our wedding weekend, some ideas on where to stay, and what to do (Joe didn't want to include this in the invitation as "we are not sending out welcome packs!") Use the links in the pretty lilac sidebar to find out more.

For the tech savvy guests who have made it this far, you can go one step further and respond to our invitation electronically via t'internet. Our contact details are provided in the [Contact Us](/contact.html) page

Please get in touch with us if you have any questions. We'll be keeping this page updated as they come in.

**What's your colour scheme?**

Erm, you've had enough clues to work that one out yourself!

**Is there WiFi?**

Yes, it was one of Joe's selection criteria. You might have to wander a bit to get phone signal at South Farm though!

**Is there parking at South Farm?**

Yes, but first priority goes to the groom, the best man, and the father of the bride - AKA the Ford Owners' Club.

Cars *can* be left overnight and collected the next day.

**What is the dinosaur on the Weekend page?**

Funny you should ask. It's a Deinonychus. Jurassic Park is the greatest film ever made. However, a certain amount of artistic licence was taken in portraying the Velociraptor. Velociraptors are really about half the height of an adult human. Not very threatening right? However, the related species, the Deinonychus, is much bigger and more scary. So Spielberg used them instead. Justifiably so in my opinion.
